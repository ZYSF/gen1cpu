# Instruction Set

## Encoding

Instructions are generally categorised by the highest nibble with the nibble below that
usually being an ALU operation or other sub-instruction. For example, to add registers you'd use 0xA1 (ALU op #1)
whereas to add an immediate value you'd use the same ALU subcode but the immediate supercode: 0x11 (immediate op #1).

These categories aren't a hard-and-fast rule, future processors may condense additional instructions into
unused opcodes regardless of categories, but it is designed to make recognising and producing the basic
instructions easier for humans.

For this same reason, opcodes and operands are generally aligned on 4- or
8-bit boundaries, so e.g. register #3 either looks like "3" or "03" in hex (depending on whether it's in a
4-bit or 8-bit operand). This encoding allows for addressing up to 256 different registers in most instructions
and up to 16 in instructions with more bits reserved for immediate values.

### Main Encoding Types

* Instructions encoded "abc" style use 8 bits each to specify up to 3 different registers (if some are disabled then the encoding is known as e.g. "axc")
* Instructions encoded "abi", "bci" or "bca" style all use 4 bits each to specify up to 2 different registers, and then use the lower 16 bits to specify an immediate or address operand
* Instructions encoded "l24" are optimised load instructions, with the minor opcode (4 bits) specifying the target register and the lower 24 bits to specify an immediate operand
* Instructions encoded with "x" symbols should assume zeroes for any relevant/remaining bits (but in some cases this space can be used for system-specific information, e.g. a debugger can add extra metadata to a trap instruction)

For convenience, the descriptions below list their arguments in hex style, so a regular "abc" operation is written something like `0xA1aabbcc` (indicating that it takes two hex digits to encode each register number for the `0xA1` instruction).

Note that the register given as `a` is generally the "target register" (or whatever register is written to). This is why e.g. in an `ifequals` instruction the two register parameters are named `b` and `c` (since it compares two registers but doesn't write to any) whereas in a `read32` instruction they're named `a` and `b` (because it reads from one register and writest to another). In practice, it's often sensible to use the same register as both a source and a target (e.g. `add $r1, $r1, $r3` would effectively add the value of `$r3` to whatever's already in `$r1`), but generally the instructions will _only read_ from whatever is `b` or `c` and _only write_ to `a`.

## Instructions

### Syscall

    OP_SYSCALL		0x00

    0x00??????: ???

Invalid instruction, but reserved for encoding system calls.

### Addimm

    OP_ADDIMM			0x11
  
    0x11abiiii: a=b+i;

Adds an immediate value to the value of a register, storing the result in a register.

NOTE: Can only access lower 16 registers due to encoding.
  
### Add

    OP_ADD				0xhA1
  
    0xA1aabbcc: a=b+c;

Adds the value of two registers together, storing the result in a register.

This encoding (which is shared for most other basic math operations) allows up to 256 registers, but higher ones might be disabled.

### Sub

    OP_SUB				0xA2
  
    0xA2aabbcc: a=b-c;

### And

    OP_AND				0xhA3
  
### Or
  
    OP_OR				0xA4

### Xor
  
    OP_XOR				0xA5

### Shl (shift left)

    OP_SHL				0xA6

### Shrz (shift right, with zero used for any assumed high bits)

    OP_SHRZ			0xA7

### Shrs (shift right, with the sign bit used for any assumed high bits)

    OP_SHRS			0xA8

### Blink (branch-link, stores the return address as though branching but doesn't do the actual branch)

    OP_BLINK			0xB1
  
    0xB1aaxxxx: a = pc + 4;
  
This instruction can be used to get a basis for calculating code-relative addresses if necessary.

### Bto (branch-to, as in a simple goto using a register as the target)

    OP_BTO				0xB2
  
    0xB2xxxxcc: npc = c;

This instruction just branches to the location in the given register.

### Be (branch-enter, stores the return address and branch to somewhere)

    OP_BE				0xB3
  
    0xB3aaxxcc: a = pc + 4; npc = c;

This is short for branch-and-enter.

### Before (for explicit mode-switching)

    OP_BEFORE			0xB4
  
    0xB4xxxxxx: npc = before; nflags = mirrorflags; nmirrorflags = flags; nbefore = mirrorbefore; nmirrorbefore = before;

Mode-switching (whether explicit or caused by an exception or interrupt) mostly involves swapping out some important context information for mirror copies. That is, the code which is currently running has it's own copy, and when the mode is switched, some different code starts executing with a different copy of the context information.

The important part here is that we're never left in-between contexts or part-way-through an instruction (the switching itself all happens within the space of one instruction, whether under explicit or exceptional circumstances). The switching should do just enough to allow a control routine to handle the situation properly (or just enough to return control back to the normal program) but shouldn't do too much that it becomes inefficient (for example, there's no need to automatically save/restore all the general-purpose registers).

### Bait (enters a trap)

    OP_BAIT			0xB8
  
    0xB8xxxxxx: ???
  
Invalid instruction, but reserved for traps. That is, if a debugger replaces an instruction with a special one to trigger an exception back into the debugger, then it will probably be one of these instructions.

### Ctrlin64 (read 64-bit processor info)

    OP_CTRLIN64		0xC3
  
    0xC3axiiii: a=ctrl[i];

Control registers (which are used for internal circuits like the timer) are accessed similarly to the memory interface, except that the size of values always corresponds to the internal register size and control registers are indexed counting in 1 rather than word sizes (ensuring there is never any ambiguity about the basic operations).

The other difference is that the base register (which the immediate value would otherwise be added to to get the final address) has been removed from the control register instructions. This is to ensure that control register can be accessed without needing a clear register (since they might be used for saving an initial register during context switching, so that it can then be free to calculate locations to save the others).

### Ctrlout64 (write 64-bit processor info)

    OP_CTRLOUT64		0xCB
  
    0xCBxciiii: ctrl[i]=c;

### Ctrlin32 (read 32-bit co/processor info)

NOTE: This is a planned instruction for 32-bit versions. Control registers in a 64-bit processor/mode are always 64-bits, but some may still be restricted for compatibility with 32-bit implementations (or compatibility modes).

    OP_CTRLIN32		0xC2
  
    0xC3axiiii: a=ctrl[i];

Control registers (which are used for internal circuits like the timer) are accessed similarly to the memory interface, except that the size of values always corresponds to the internal register size and control registers are indexed counting in 1 rather than word sizes (ensuring there is never any ambiguity about the basic operations).

The other difference is that the base register (which the immediate value would otherwise be added to to get the final address) has been removed from the control register instructions. This is to ensure that control register can be accessed without needing a clear register (since they might be used for saving an initial register during context switching, so that it can then be free to calculate locations to save the others).

### Ctrlout32 (write 32-bit co/processor info)

NOTE: This is a planned instruction for 32-bit versions. Control registers in a 64-bit processor/mode are always 64-bits, but some may still be restricted for compatibility with 32-bit implementations (or compatibility modes).

    OP_CTRLOUT32		0xCA
  
    0xCBxciiii: ctrl[i]=c;

### Read32 (read data memory)

    OP_READ32			0xD2
  
    0xD2abiiii: a=data[b+i];

The standard memory bus allows for 64-bit addresses but only handles 32 bits of data at a time. When reading a value (into a 64-bit register), it is *not* sign-extended (TODO: Test this).

Implementations may provide specialised instructions and/or specialised hardware interfaces for dealing with other sizes, but as a standard 32-bit reads/writes are probably the most practical.

Implementations can also either ignore or raise errors if the higher/lower bits of the addresses are not what they expect, or more generally if the address is protected or just beyond memory (this generally means that read/write addresses should be multiples of four, and that any unused higher bits should be left as zero).

### Read16 (planned)

    OP_READ16			0xD1
  
    0xD1abiiii: a=data[b+i];

Only reads the lower 16 bits, the rest of the register is reset to zero.
    
### Read8 (planned)

    OP_READ8			0xD0
  
    0xD0abiiii: a=data[b+i];

Only reads the lower 8 bits, the rest of the target register is reset to zero.

### Read16x (planned)

    OP_READ16x			0xD5
  
    0xD5abiiii: a=data[b+i];

Reads 16 bits from memory and sign-extends it to fill the target register.
    
### Read8x (planned)

    OP_READ8x			0xD4
  
    0xD4abiiii: a=data[b+i];

Reads 8 bits from memory and sign-extends it to fill the target register.

### Read32x (planned)

    OP_READ32x			0xD6
  
    0xD6abiiii: a=data[b+i];

Reads 32 bits from memory and sign-extends it to fill the target register.

NOTE: This is only meaningful for 64-bit implementations, and need not be implemented on 32-bit versions.

### Write32 (write data memory)

    OP_WRITE32		0xDA
  
    0xDAbciiii: data[b+i]=c;
    
This only writes lower 32 bits of register (or the whole thing in 32-bit implementations).

### Write16 (planned)

    OP_WRITE16      0xD9
    
    0xD9bciiii: data[b+i]=c; // Only writes lower 16 bits of register

### Write8 (planned)

    OP_WRITE8      0xD8
    
    0xD8bciiii: data[b+i]=c; // Only writes lower 8 bits of register

### In32 (read I/O)

    OP_IN32			0xE2
  
    0xE2abiiii: a=ext[b+i];
  
The I/O bus operates *exactly* like the memory bus, except it's the I/O bus, and it can only be accessed from system-mode (unless an implementation has a special feature to expose part of it to user-mode).

In other words, it's just like a secondary channel of memory, except that it could be implemented entirely separately to memory so I/O devices can't overhear any memory stuff and memory devices can't overhear any I/O stuff.

This is also the case for the instruction bus (which would typically match the memory bus but not necessarily). For the sake of simplicity, the current interface shares a single set of data/address wires, but the design allows for more-secured or more-optimised implementations to bypass the normal "data memory" bus entirely for both code and I/O operations.

### Out32 (write I/O)

    OP_OUT32			0xEA
  
    0xEAbciiii: ext[b+i]=c;

### Ifabove (for conditional branching comparing unsigned integers)

    OP_IFABOVE		0xFA
  
    0xFAbcaaaa: if((unsigned) b > (unsigned) c){npc = (pc & (-1 << 18)) | (i<<2);}

Conditionals use the constant in a special way (which should be handled automatically by the assembler). All 16 bits of the encoded value replace the third to eightenth bits of the existing program counter, meaning they can target anywhere within the same 256 kilobyte-aligned space. In other words, to encode a nearby address as a target, shift it right by two before encoding as a normal "bci"-type instruction.

### Ifbelows (for conditional branching comparing signed integers)

    OP_IFBELOWS		0xFB
  
    0xFBbcaaaa: if((signed) b < (signed) c){npc = (pc & (-1 << 18)) | (i<<2);}

### Ifequals (for conditional branching based on bit-equality)

    OP_IFEQUALS		0xFE
  
    0xFEbcaaaa: if(b == c){npc = (pc & (-1 << 18)) | (i<<2);}

This can also be used for unconditional jumps to local addresses (since any register always equals itself).

## Recently-Added Instructions

These have only just been added at time of writing and haven't really been tested yet:

The first set may be replaced or re-encoded in favour of more rational extended read/write operations (see "planned" instructions):

* 0xD6 - read32h (same as read32 except replaces the high 32 bits of the register without altering the low bits)
* 0xDE - write32h (same as write32 except takes the data from the high 32 bits of the register)
* 0xE6 - in32h (like read32h except for I/O bus)
* 0xEE - out32h (like write32h except for I/O bus)

The second set are more specialised, and are likely to stay.

* 0x3x - ld24 (optimised load instruction which can reset any of the lower 16 registers based on a 24-bit immediate value)
* 0x1D - ldsll6imm (designed for appending additional bits to a loaded value, by shifting an existing value left by 16 bits and replacing the lower 16 bits with the immediate value)
* 0x9x - xlu (designed for accessing extended ALU-like operations, allowing for up to 65536 different operations using the lower 16 registers)

This functionality can always be implemented in software, but the amount of bit-shifting just to read/write a 64-bit value would be annoying. Encoding may change before implementation (but this is the encoding now supported by the assembler).

On a full 64-bit hardware bus, all of the 32-bit memory implementations could still be implemented (the bus would need to support 32-bit access for instruction fetching anyway), but optimised instructions for 64-bit reads/writes would use the suboperations 0x3 and 0xB (indicating 64-bit read/write like with the ctrlin64/ctrlout64 instructions).

## Enhancements Which May Be Needed

* Particularly to run C programs smoothly, optimised 64-bit memory operations would be handy. (See above.)
* Semantics of loading smaller values also need to be clarified (particularly at which points sign extension happens).
* For system code, an additional control register or two just for storing cached pointers (e.g. to the task structure) would be helpful.
* There are probably some other cases where common code sequences can be replaced with a single optimised instruction.
* Floating point support would be generally helpful (especially for porting C programs).
